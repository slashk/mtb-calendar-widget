h2. MTBcalendar OSX Dashboard Widget

This is a little widget which lets you see regional MTB race calendars from 
the "MTB Calendar":http://www.mtbcalendar.com/ website.

h3. Installation

Installing the widget should be dead simple on a Mac OS X machine running 10.4.3
of higher. Simply download the newest version from the "release" directory (it's
fastest to download the ".zip" version"), double-click the file on your hard drive
to uncompress it and then double-click the newly uncompressed file to install it 
(it will have an icon of a bicycle crank). Your Mac should ask you if you want
to install it on your dashboard -- simply click yes.

h3. Configuration and Usage

This widget will allow you to see upcoming MTB events that have been entered
on the mtbcalendar.com site.

The only preference setting on this widget is accessible via the back panel 
(click the (i) icon in the lower right hand corner to show). It is a pulldown 
menu which lists different regions so that you can find races closest to where 
you live. It defaults to "Northern California" (_hells yeah_) but you can set 
it to any region you choose. The regions are mostly small cluster of states, 
but some states are split (like California).

To see more details about any race event, simply click on the events name on the 
front panel and it will take you to the appropriate page on the 
"MTB Calendar":http://www.mtbcalendar.com/ website.

h3. Source 

This widget was created with Apple's "Dashcode":http://www.apple.com/macosx/developertools/dashcode.html
and follows most of their setup conventions. However, I have added "Prototype javascript library":http://www.prototypejs.org/ 
 (version 1.6.0.3).
